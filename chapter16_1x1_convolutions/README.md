## Chapter 16 1x1 Conv Layer

Examples from chapter 16 of Deep Learning For Computer Vision

## Notes

* The 1x1 filter can be used to create a linear projection of a stack of feature maps.

* The projection created by a 1x1 filter can act like channel-wise pooling and be used for dimensionality reduction.

* The projection created by a 1x1 filter can also be used directly or be used to increase the number of feature maps in a model.
