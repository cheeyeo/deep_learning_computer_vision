## Object Recognition with YOLOv3

Example model that does object recognition with YOLOv3

Based on code from chapter 24 of Deep Learning For Computer Vision and https://github.com/experiencor/keras-yolov3

To create the initial model, you need to obtain the weights from https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights and save the created model.

## Extensions

* Use YOLO model to perform object recognition on your own photograph

* Use a library such as OpenCV to load a video and perform object recognition on each frame

* Experiment by downloading and running the official DarkNET/YOLO implementation and compare the results to the current Keras implementation
