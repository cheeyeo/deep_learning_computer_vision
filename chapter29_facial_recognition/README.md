## Face Identification and Verification with VGGFace2

Chapter 29 of `Deep Learning for Computer Vision` which uses a pre-trained VGG model to perform face identification and verification

## Extensions

* Try training the VGG model on new dataset

* Find some photos of celebrities known to the model that fail to be identified correctly and see if identification can be improved with image pre processing

* Generate embeddings for new faces not used to train the model and determine if they can be used for a basic validation system.
